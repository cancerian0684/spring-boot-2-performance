= spring-boot-2-performance metrics

== Starting the server
First step is to build the project and then start the server from terminal.

.Gradle build
    ./gradlew clean build

.Start the server
    $ cd build/libs
    $ java -Xms512m -jar <artifact.jar>

Now the server shall start on port 8080 ready for serving the requests.


== Install wrk tool for performance testing

.wrk - a HTTP benchmarking tool
****

wrk is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.

.More Information

****

.Installation on Ubuntu
To install wrk on ubuntu 18.04 system, just run the below command

    sudo apt install wrk

Now wrk is ready for the testing.

== Benchmarking Metrics
Now start the Spring Boot application and run the below command from terminal

    $ wrk -t8 -c40 -d30s http://localhost:8080/api/perf

This will launch 8 threads and keep 40 HTTP open connections for a duration of 30s and measure the results.

So we can see that a simple ping controller gives throughput of 31000 requests per second, which is not bad at all.

== Using h2load for HTTP Benchmarking
h2load is another high performance HTTP benchmarking tool that we can use to bench mark our API.

.h2load to send 100000 requests using 50 concurrency level
    $ h2load -n100000 -c50 --h1 http://localhost:8080/api/perf

We can see that with latest version of Spring Boot 2.2.0, we can get a throughput of `62K requests/second` on the same Ubuntu 18.04.2 server.
