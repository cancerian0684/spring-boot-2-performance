== Install wrk tool for performance testing

.wrk - a HTTP benchmarking tool
****

wrk is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.

Now wrk is ready for the testing.

== Step 5. Benchmarking
Now start the Spring Boot application and run the below command from terminal

    wrk -t8 -c40 -d30s http://localhost:8080/api/perf

This will launch 8 threads and keep 40 HTTP open connections for a duration of 30s and measure the results.

So we can see that a simple ping controller gives throughput of 31000 requests per second, which is not bad at all.
